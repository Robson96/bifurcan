This library provides flexible, high-quality implementations of functional data structures, in Java.

There are a number of existing JVM libraries in this space, including those in the Clojure and Scala standard libraries.  However, these libraries tend to bring a large number of tangential code along for the ride.  For instance, the collections in the [Functional Java](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava) library assume and encourage the use of all the surrounding abstractions.  Clojure's data structures, while implemented in Java, are hard-coded to use Clojure's equality semantics, and in some places specially optimized for use with Clojure's keyword type.

These libraries are all-or-nothing propositions: they work great as long as you also adopt the surrounding ecosystem.  Historically, given the lack of functional primitives in Java's standard library, this made a lot of sense.  With the introduction of lambdas, streams, et al in Java 8, however, this is no longer required.

This library builds only on the primitives provided by the Java 8 standard library.  Rather than using the existing collection interfaces in `java.util` such as `List` or `Map`, it provides its own interfaces (`IList`, `IMap`, `ISet`) that provide functional semantics - each update to a collection returns a reference to a new collection.  Each interface provides a method (`toList`, `toMap`, `toSet`) for coercing the collection to a read-only version of the standard Java interfaces.

### "linear" and "forked" collections

Functional collections are typically *persistent*, meaning that every version of the data structure can be accessed, even after changes are made.  This can be done efficiently by using trees for storage, and sharing common structure between all the versions.  Even so, these implementations require more time and memory than their mutable counterparts.

Persistent data structures keep us from having to worry what other functions or threads are doing to our data.  However, if no one else can see our data, we don't need such strong guarantees.  If we need to construct a map with a thousand entries, we don't care about every intermediate version, just the final one.

In the literature, non-persistent data structures are called *ephemeral*, and in Clojure they're called *transient*.  Any persistent Clojure data structure can be turned into a transient version of itself, updated, and then returned to a persistent state.  Since transient data structures are allowed to overwrite previous versions of themselves, they can close the performance gap with mutable collections.

Bifurcan provides both ephemeral and persistent implementations of each collection, called "linear" and "forked" respectively.  This is meant to reflect the data flow of each use case: an ephemeral collection has a single downstream consumer, while a persistent data structure may have many.

Any data structure can be turned into a linear or forked variant of itself via `linear()` and `forked()`.  However, in the special case where a forked variant isn't required, Bifurcan provides special `LinearList`, `LinearMap`, and `LinearSet` implementations that provide equivalent performance to Java's mutable collections.
